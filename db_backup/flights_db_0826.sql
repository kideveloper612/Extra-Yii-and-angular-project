He told me I needed to go on line myself, pay more and upgrade the ticket myself? What? I thought I already paid for this for both of these tickets.

I found a pretty good price for a two-stop flight each way with Asiana Airlines from South Korea and Jetblue Airways in the USA. The tickets were bought about five weeks before departure but at four weeks or so before departure Asiana Air made a small schedule change of 45 minutes from Seoul to JFK. What followed was a whole week of unnecessary incompetence concerning my trip from Cheap Tickets&#39; customer service. <br /><br />All that needed to be said was that JetBlue wanted a minimum of 2 hours 30 mins to take responsibility for international transfers from sister airlines like Asiana Air but Cheap Tickets started calling and telling me that I had to cancel my trip and rebook. My layover was reduced from 2 hours 54 mins to 2 hours and 9 mins because of Asiana&#8217;s small schedule change.<br /> <br />I actually had three options for this common situation that any literate travel agent should have seen straight away: 1) Accept the change and take responsibility for a missed connection at JFK. 2) Take a later Jetblue flight from JFK with its longer layover or 3) Cancel the tickets and get a refund. <br /><br />I was told by several customer service representatives via email and on the phone that option number 3 was the only option for six straight days. I refused to believe that was true and refused to cancel my trip. Rebooking at that time would have increased my total travel time and cost me about 25% more on tickets. The agents at Cheap Tickets clearly do not understand their job. <br /><br />It took a week of daily phone calls and emails to get to a point that I would have expected on day one. The emails I received had grammar errors, generic cut and paste verbiage that did not apply to my situation, and incorrect information. Even the supervisors at Cheap Tickets don&#39;t seem to understand their job at a basic level.

Will never fly with Swiss again. I&#8217;ve traveled near and far and every other airline I&#8217;ve ever been on has had impeccable customer service in times of trouble. I flew from Amsterdam to Zurich today and my bag was lost somehow (even thought it was a direct flight only lasting an hour and my traveling companion&#8217;s bag was received immediately). When I first approached the customer service rep in Zurich airport baggage claim she was rude, unaccommodating and unapologetic. She offered no help in mending the situation. I am now in Switzerland with zero belongings, besides the books and charging cables which were in my carry on. After fussing with service reps I was told to file a report. Finally the bag was located STILL IN AMSTERDAM airport! The bag contained thousands of dollars of belonging and somehow SWISS is allowed to have a policy that only issues $100 of replacements to passengers flying in economy, BUT issues $300 to those in first class. ABSURD. I have been on and off the phone all day, completely ruined/wasted a day of my vacation, have been offered no reparations for the airlines mistake and here I am 12 hours later still waiting to find out when I will get my bag back and how. The worst experience I&#8217;ve ever had while traveling and I will not advise anyone to use Swiss air again. There are far better airlines that have higher focus on customer service and are more apologetic for their mistakes as well as try to help you in mending them. I am not angry that the bag was lost, as I understand this is a risk any traveler takes when checking a bag however I am irate in the way it was handled both in the airport and on the customer service phone lines throughout the day. Also a $100 stipend could buy me a new pair of sandals and a bra here in Switzerland, an outrageous offering from a multi billion dollar company that obviously cares little about customer comfort and satisfaction. Hopefully my bag turns up soon. Do not check bags with Swiss air unless you fully understand their ridiculous policy surrounding reparations for lost baggage. I wish I hadn&#8217;t','SWISS'),

Paying a small amount more for &quot;extra legroom&quot; seats also gets you priority boarding. And everybody gets drinks and a snack without having to buy them.

When I have landed in Amsterdam on time and checked the gate information and went directly to the gate and waited to get onboard. But when I was getting onboard, I discovered I was at the wrong gate and my flight with KLM(operated by Delta has gone). I was very upset, as I didn&#39;t hear any announcement to call me to the gate, I was sitting just tenth meters away. When the airline knew that I have arrived to the airport and I have checked in, and my luggage was loaded on the plane, why don&#39;t they call me the missing passenger to the gate? As at all other airports I have been to(at least 150 cities in the world), I always heard final calls to passengers to the gate, but KLM/Delta didn&#39;t! Which resulted that I have to pay extra money to get on next flight and arrived to Montreal 5 hours later than my original ticket. I contacted customer service and KLM CEO&#39;s office, they just told me that it was my own fault that I didn&#39;t keep check with the gate information. I consider that is bad service!

Then I took the last minute Air India flight with premium pricing of £3500 and lost the whole ticket money £1800 I paid for Swiss airline.

When I was doing check in they never had an issue and my luggage gone to the flight. That means the counter staff not aware of this and sure that there is no issues with my documentation.

NO THANK YOU.<br /><br />This is my story about the incredible poor service I have received so far from Swiss International airlines .<br /><br />On Jul 12, 2019, I took Flight LX87 from Montreal. connecting in Zurich, with flight LX420 to Birmingham, where I landed on June 13th, 2019 at approx. 8:00 hrs.<br />Unfortunately, my suitcase did not follow me.<br /><br />At the Birmingham Intl Airport, I promptly filled out the required Property Irregularity Report.<br />It was determined that my suitcase had remained in Montreal but was supposed to be placed on a flight later that day to Birmingham. This was confirmed in a personal email to me.<br />Despite continuing update request emails being sent to Montreal by the Birmingham lost baggage dept&#8217;, Montreal SWISS did not respond to any of the requests.<br /><br />On the morning of July 16, 2019 , I had no option but to terminate my 10 day trip to Birmingham and return to Montreal to get some answers and personally obtain my suitcase. I based my decision on the following.<br /><br />1. Having been officially notified, on the same day of my arrival, that my luggage was located in Montreal and was to be sent to Birmingham on the next flight.<br /><br />2. Being informed that Swiss Montreal still had not responded to the various requests from the Birmingham lost luggage department on July 13, 14, 15 and 16 re: my suitcase. This being four days after the initial request was made and despite my suitcase having been located in Montreal.<br /><br />3. Being informed on the 16th that my luggage still had not arrived in Birmingham<br /><br />Subsequently, on July 16th I took the train at 5:30 from Birmingham to Gatwick airport with a connecting AirTransat flight TS 729 to Montreal.<br /><br />All this to reclaim my suitcase which was confirmed to be in Montreal, not lost, but that Swiss International airlines failed to send it to Birmingham despite multiple requests to do so.<br /><br />Upon my arrival in Montreal, I immediately went to the Lufthansa/Swissair Lost baggage dept. The employees manning the counter were not very helpful in locating my bag.<br />By chance the on-floor luggage attendant overheard my conversation. She asked me whether my suitcase was blue and a hard case. When I replied, yes, she said she knew where it was.<br />She proceeded to get it and 20 minutes later returned with my bag which had a red RUSH sign taped to the handle.<br /><br />Well, no one at Swiss rushed. The suitcase was never placed on a plane and they never bothered to respond to the multiple requests from the Birmingham lost baggage department.<br /><br />Consequently my trip to Birmingham, was completely ruined by the incompetent and inaction of Swiss personnel.<br /><br />As such, I am claiming full compensation for the expenses incurred on this trip: compensation for my original flight; compensation for the transportation costs of my return trip from Birmingham to Montreal, loss of Holiday enjoyment and for medical distress due to lack of my medication.<br /><br />So far, they have offered $407 which I refused. What incompetent and disgraceful service.<br /><br />THINK TWICE BEFORE FLYING SWISS INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES.','SWISS'),

I tried to buy checked in luggage online and their agent told me (in writing) that I simply cannot buy online and that I had to buy it at the airport. IT COSTS DOUBLE THE PRICE! Such a cunning way to make money, bravo!<br /><br />3) I was not allowed to check in or select my seat, and I had to do so at the airport. I suffer from rheumatoid arthritis and I always take an aisle seat so that I can move my legs as sitting still for long is very very very bad for my health. I asked them to allocate an aisle seat for me (about a dozen times before the flight, way in advance). By the time they could so kindly reply, all the aisle seats were gone. I repeatedly told them about my medical condition and they just could not be bothered doing anything to relieve my stress which was caused by their ignorant mistakes and behaviour.<br /><br />If this is not enough for you to give up on KLM, please bear with me a little longer and read about the flight experience:<br /><br />Flight experience:<br /><br />1) I travel frequently for work and because of this I&#8217;ve flown with many airlines from Qatar to Ryanair or from Malaysian Airlines to Adria to Turkish Airlines. Including all of the budget ones, KLM&#8217;s seats are by far the absolute worst! Wanna sit on cardboard seats for 11 hours? Then KLM is just the right airline for you!<br /><br />2) The food. Oh dear. Needless to add to this.<br /><br />3) I&#8217;ve never seen an airline toilet so dirty. Another first for me. Thanks KLM.<br /><br /><br />I will never again choose this airline and will make sure neither my friends and family nor my company flies with KLM. They do not deserve a single penny I paid for this flight.','KLM/AirFrance'),

Airhelp will help to get some of your money back but at a cost , approximately 20% of what your refund will be.

I was within 24 hours of reserving that flight, so I was allowed to do that. Simple matter, right? Thirteen emails and three customer service calls later, I may have succeeded. My complaint is threefold: Although I speak 3 languages and have worked with a few Filipinos on a professional level, I was unable to understand 80% of what the customer service representatives were saying. It was a horrible communication experience. Just as bad, or even worse, was their inability to think analytically. They (and I&#39;m including the supervisor with whom I spoke) were very willing to try to help me process the flight change, but each time that a complication arose (and the complications were not extreme and were probably inevitable), the customer service reps could not deal with it. They instead resorted to reciting polite, canned scripts they apparently had been given...scripts that did not address the matter to be solved. They thought, I suppose, that bs&#39;ing in this way would substitute for competence. Courtesy and patience, plenty. Simple thinking ability, minimal. Ability to explain to me what they had done, zero. Finally, their website sux as concerns documenting changes or anything out of the ordinary. It was obviously programmed on the cheap by persons whose intent was to create a system that can handle only the simplest and problem-free transactions. Like the customer service representatives, any required tweaking of flight reservation resulted in the system giving either incorrect information or only half correct information. The Expedia system seems to me to be a house of cards developed by people working at and for Expedia who are, frankly, not very bright and lacking in ability to perform professionally.

Though expensive we added that. <br /><br />When we checked into the Avis counter at the airport in Tel Aviv we were told not only that the insurance purchased was not sufficient to cover against 100% of collision value, but also that it did not cover any liability. Furthermore, they would not rent us the car without liability insurance and they only offered one insurance package which had collision plus liability. This package cost a lot more than the one online. In fact, more than the rental of the car ! They suggested we cancel the Expedia policy since it had not started yet and had not been used. We tried to call Expedia of course to no avail we were waiting for an hour. When we finally reached them they said they said they would have to call Avis to verify that we bought their insurance. They later sent us an email days later saying they were very busy and they could not reach Avis. Can you believe it ? In our day and age they could not use email ?<br /><br />We wrote emails and called profusely to no avail for almost a month. They still have not refunded our money. Shame on you Expedia for this pathetic customer service and for not indicating this issue on your website during the booking. <br /><br />If you ever rent a car in Israel, dimon&#8217;t ever buy Expedia&#8217;s insurance.

They have clearly had this issue before because as soon as I explained the issue I was offered half of the $65.32 and was explained that the number I was shown initially was the price per day. I checked consumer review websites after that and saw that many customers had filed the same complaint as I had and that the trip cancellation insurance is a misadvertised protection plan and purposely deceptive. I will continue to file complaints with both the airline and on consumer websites until I am offered a full refund for the trip cancellation insurance. <br /><br />After only an hour of using this service I am already incredibly disappointed and unimpressed by Flight Network and will NEVER USE THE WEBSITE AGAIN TO BUY A FLIGHT UNLESS THERE IS A DRASTIC change in the way that I am being treated as a customer.','FlightNetwork'),
